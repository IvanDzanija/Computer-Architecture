# Computer Architecture

This repository contains solutions and supporting code for the **Computer
Architecture 2** course labs at FER.

## Description

Laboratory exercises focus on practical aspects of computer architecture,
emphasizing how architectural design decisions impact software performance and
opportunities for parallelism at different levels. The labs utilize tools for
simulating and analyzing processor microarchitecture, programming in C and
assembly, and working with GPU computing.

## Laboratory Exercises

- **Lab 1 – Microprogramming**
    - Implementing a simple processor using microprogrammed control
    - Simulating an instruction set with the provided "mythsim" simulator

- **Lab 2 – Assembly Language Programming**
    - Writing programs in the processor instruction set (assembler)
    - Combining assembly code with higher-level languages (C)
    - Analyzing program behavior at instruction level and working with
      stack/memory

- **Lab 3 – Architectural Impact on Programs**
    - Measuring and analyzing the performance of different function
      implementations
    - Evaluating how microarchitectural features (pipelining, cache, etc.)
      affect execution speed
    - Experimenting with architectural changes and observing their effects on
      performance

- **Lab 4 – GPU Programming (OpenCL)**
    - Fundamentals of parallel programming on graphics processors
    - Implementing and testing simple programs in OpenCL
